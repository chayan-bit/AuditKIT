"""Shared paired-bootstrap significance test.

Both the model-comparison path (`model_compare.py`) and the experiment path
(`experiment.py`) need the same test — a two-sided paired bootstrap over
per-sample (baseline, candidate) score pairs — so it lives here once instead of
being reimplemented (and drifting) in each. The old copies also aligned the two
runs' scores by list *position*, which silently mispaired samples whenever the
runs' prediction order diverged (partial failures, retries, caching); callers
here align **by sample_id** via :func:`score_pairs`.
